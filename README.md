# Infinite-Monkey-Theorem-using-python

This infinity monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time 
will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely 
type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. But to write complex writing such as that of a poet is far more 
hard and incomprehensible in a time period since the probability of that happening is really scarce.

Hence, this is a dig at the theorem by automating the task of the monkey i.e. by the program.
Enter any string you want to check and let the program run for the time that it may take to type in that particular string.
